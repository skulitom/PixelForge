# Contributing to PixelForge

Contributions from people and agents are welcome. Keep the project focused on editable pixel art recipes, deterministic exports and a useful inspect/revise loop.

## Local setup

Install Node.js 20 or newer, clone your fork and run:

```sh
npm test
node bin/pixelforge.js preview
```

There are no dependencies to install and no build step. The preview studio opens at `http://127.0.0.1:4747`. Run CLI commands from the repository root.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the architecture and project constraints. Agents authoring artwork should also read the [pixel art skill](skills/pixel-art/SKILL.md) and [authoring reference](docs/agent-guide.md).

## Propose a change

Open an issue for substantial features or format changes so the scope can be discussed first. For a bug, include the Node.js version, operating system, exact command, expected result, actual result and a minimal recipe if relevant. Remove private paths and credentials from logs.

External contributors should use a branch in their fork and submit a focused pull request. Explain the user-visible result and how you verified it. Documentation fixes and small bug fixes can go straight to a pull request. Agents working for the repository owner follow the standing direct-to-`main` commit and push authorization in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); routine confirmation or a pull request is not required after review and successful checks.

## Verify your work

- Run `npm test` after functional changes. Add a regression test when fixing behavior that the existing tests do not cover.
- Keep runtime validation, [schema.json](schema.json) and [the authoring reference](docs/agent-guide.md) aligned. Regenerate the schemas (`schema.json`, `poses.schema.json`, `scene.schema.json`, `autotile.schema.json`, `fx.schema.json`) with `node scripts/generate-schema.js` when intentionally changing a format, and review the diff.
- When intentionally changing bundled examples, use `node scripts/generate-examples.js` and review the recipes and rendered artwork.
- For changes to binary exports, also check with an independent decoder. The optional `scripts/verify-exports.py` check uses Python and Pillow after `npm run demo`. If `output/forest-spirit` already exists, preserve or move that output before running the demo again. `scripts/verify-trim.py` checks trimmed atlases the same way and needs no prior output.
- For studio changes, run `node scripts/qa-studio.mjs` (Node.js 22+ and an installed Edge or Chrome; nothing else is needed). It walks the studio in a headless browser with a throwaway profile: every sample, editing, a broken recipe, the controls, Save, Open, Export and GIF downloads, draft recovery, keyboard access and narrow and wide windows, and keeps screenshots under `output/studio-qa`. Still look at the preview yourself at narrow and wide sizes, with the keyboard, and with animation playing. For artwork changes, inspect every frame, not just recipe validity.
- For changes to `packaging/` or the portable build scripts, build and verify on the system you changed: `node scripts/build-studio.mjs --allow-dirty --out <fresh folder>`, then `node scripts/verify-studio.mjs <the archive> --allow-dev`. `npm test` runs the same checks against a stand-in runtime on Windows, macOS and Linux, and CI verifies every target on its own system.

Keep the core and runtime dependency-free. Use Node.js standard APIs for the CLI, file formats and local server. Preserve the text-first workflow, overwrite protection, loopback binding and explicit server asset allowlist.
